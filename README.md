===============

Implementation of [The Little Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Schemer-4th-Edition/dp/0262560992) in Kotlin

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is a learning exercise to think about functional programming
with lists, recursion and composition.


### Implementation Notes

The code here is not meant to be optimal nor necessarily be idiomatic Kotlin. Primitives
are implemented in a way to remain as faithful as possible to the original The Little Schemer
definitions in Scheme.

Implementations need to follow the **The Ten Commandments** outlined in the book.
As definitions are being built while going through the book, some might be refactored as
new definitions appear.


### Structure


[**Definitions**](https://github.com/hhariri/little-kotliner/blob/master/src/com/hadihariri/littleKotliner/Definitions.kt) hold all the definitions from the book. Each definition usually has its own
[test](https://github.com/hhariri/little-kotliner/blob/master/test/com/hadihariri/littleKotliner/tests) classes under **test** folder.


## License

All code and work here is provided under the BSD Modified license.
Passages and references from The Little Schemer are used under the "Fair Use" act.

I highly recommend [you purchase the book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Schemer-4th-Edition/dp/0262560992) and read it.
